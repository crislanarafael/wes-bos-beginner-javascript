# Wes Bos Beginner Javascript Notes
A repo documenting my personal progress on Wes Bos' Beginner Javascript course. Started Dec. 5th, aiming to finish before the new year before my next semester starts.

## Personal Stats
I have some prior programming knowledge with Java, and have taken a beginner javascript course in the past. Looking to brush up on fundamentals and get better JS foundation so I can learn React.
